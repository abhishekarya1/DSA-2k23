- Leap Year:
  - div by `4`, if a `100` year, it should be div by `400`
  - Ex: `1900` isn't leap, despite being div by `4`
- Prime Number: https://hashdefine.netlify.app/maths
- Sieve of Eratosthenes: Loop `i -> 2 to sqrt(n), i++`, loop `j -> i*i to n, j+=i` and untick elements
  - Time - `O(n log logn)`

- Binary Power: https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html
- Euclidean Algorithm: https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html
- Fibonacci Numbers:
  - Recursion
  - Memoisation using array
  - Binet's Formula
  - Iterative that keeps track of only last two elements (space optimized)

- Shuffle the Array (such that all permutations are equally likely): https://youtu.be/hSZARPLUSDM
  - swap every element `arr[i]` with `arr[rand(i, n-1)]`, `i` is inclusive
  - intuition: at every element prob of that element landing up at that position should be `1/n` which isn't possible if we don't reduce the rand's range
