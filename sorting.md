- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort (recursive)
- Insertion Sort (recursive)
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Read sorting notes.

Terms:
stable - order of elements is maintained; unstable: quick, heap
in-place - `O(1)` space; not in-place: merge
online - 
external sorts - all data to be sorted can't be loaded in memory at the same time
comparison based sorts - bubble, merge, etc...
index based sorts - count, radix

Mathematical worst-case of any possible sort is `O(n logn)`.
